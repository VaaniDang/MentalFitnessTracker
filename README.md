# MentalFitnessTracker
The agenda of the Mental Fitness Tracker implemented using machine learning model is to analyze and interpret various input datasets which consists of country,current year,prevalence of schizophrennia,bipolar disorder,eating disorder,anxiety,drug usage disorders,depressive disorders,alcohol use disorders in an individual to provide predictions aboute the mental fitness of the particular individual.
By using 3 different regression models namely Linear Regression Model,Random Forest Regression Model and Decision Tree Regressor Model we can compare their mean squared error,root mean squared error and r squared score to find the most suitable model for the mental fitness tracker.
Heatmap can be used to visualize and analyze mental fitness relation with other parameters.
